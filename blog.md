# Project Plant AI

![Cover image](media/cover.png)

Hello developers üëã! In this article, we introduce our project ‚ÄúPlant AI ‚òòÔ∏è‚Äù and walk you through our motivation behind building this project, how it could be helpful to the community, the process of building this project, and finally our future plans with this project.

Plant AI ‚òòÔ∏è is a web application üåê that helps one to easily diagnose diseases in plants from plant images, using Machine Learning possible all on the web. We provide an interface on the website where you can simply upload images of your plant leaves since we majorly focus on plant leaf diseases and instantly know diseases the plant has. We further also provide users easy ways to solve the diagnosed disease.

Guess, what? This project is also completely open-sourced‚≠ê, here is the GitHub repo for this project: https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI

## The motivation behind building this

Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people [1]. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%.

The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with billions of crop growers having smartphones offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food.

Our motivation with this web app was to solve this problem by aiding crop growers by turning their smartphones into an easy diagnosis tool that could help increase the yield substantially and reduce crop failures. We also aim to make this rather easy for crop growers so this tool could be used on a daily basis.
